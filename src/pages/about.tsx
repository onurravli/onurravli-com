                        I was born on 23rd June 2001. I am trying to code since when I was 14.
                        Fun fact, I was started with PHP! ðŸ˜œ

                    <p className={styles.aboutMe} style={poppins.style}>
                        Now I am studying Computer Science and Engineering at Konya Technical
                        University Department of Engineering.

                        As an ambitious and highly motivated computer science and electrical engineering student, I am
                        constantly seeking new challenges to push the boundaries of my abilities. I possess a versatile
                        skill set in various programming languages, including C/C++, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python,
                        Java,
                        Dart, Rust, and Go. With a passion for software development, I have extensive experience working
                        with backend frameworks such as Node.js, Flask, and Express, as well as frontend frameworks and
                        libraries like React, Next.js, Flutter, and Swing.

                        I am a quick learner and always eager to take on new technologies, which is reflected in my
                        experience working with tools such as Git VCS, REST API, BeautifulSoup, Nmap, Setoolkit, and
                        Wireshark. Alongside my technical skills, I am also adept in graphic design software, including
                        Inkscape, GIMP, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator.

                        As a student scholar in the TÃœBÄ°TAK BÄ°Ã‡ABA Scholarship Program, I have worked on the Explosive
                        Circuit Detection from X-Ray Images Using Ensemble and Deep Learning Techniques Project, where I
                        developed and applied new methods to detect explosive circuits in X-ray images.

                        Konya Technical University&apos;s Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing Community, Amazon
                        AWS,
                        IEEE Student Branch, and GitHub Developer Program. These experiences have not only broadened my
                        horizons but also given me opportunities to work collaboratively with peers and learn from
                        experienced professionals.
